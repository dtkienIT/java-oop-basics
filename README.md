# Java OOP Practice ‚Äì Book Management

A simple Java project to practice basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including **class creation**, **encapsulation**, **instances**, and **user input handling**.

---

## üìò Project Description

This project demonstrates how to:

- Create a Java class with constructor, private attributes and public getter/setter methods.
- Use encapsulation to protect class members.
- Create and manage multiple instances of a class.
- Accept user input using the `Scanner` class.
- Display object data in a readable format using the `toString()` method.

## üß© Classes Overview

### **Book.java**

Defines the `Book` class with attributes:

- `title` ‚Äì book title  
- `author` ‚Äì book author  
- `price` ‚Äì book price  

Includes:
- Two constructors:
  - A **default constructor** that initializes `title` and `author` to `null`
  - An **overloaded constructor** that sets all attributes (`title`, `author`, `price`)
- Setter and getter methods for all attributes  
- A custom `toString()` method to display book details in a formatted way

### **BooksMenu.java**

Main class that provides an interactive console menu to:

- **View all books** currently stored  
- **Add new books**, with an option to choose between the **default** or **overloaded** constructor  
- **Compare the prices** of two books and display the more expensive one  
- Store up to **10 books** in an array  
- Handle all user input via the `Scanner` class

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

To run this project, make sure your computer has **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Check if Java is installed**

Open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
java -version
```

If you see output like:

```bash
java version "18.0.2" (or any version number)
```

then Java is already installed.

If not, continue below.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Java (if not installed)**

üîπ For Windows:

1. Go to the [Oracle Java Downloads webpage](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/?er=221886)

2. Download and install the latest Java SE Development Kit (JDK).

3. During installation, check the option to ‚ÄúSet JAVA_HOME variable‚Äù.

4. Restart your terminal.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify installation**

```bash
javac -version
```

If you see a version number (e.g. javac 18.0.2), your environment is ready.
