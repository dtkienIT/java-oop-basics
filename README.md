# Java OOP Practice ‚Äì Book Management

A simple Java project to practice basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including **class creation**, **encapsulation**, **instances**, and **user input handling**.

---

## üìò Project Description

This project demonstrates how to:

- Create a Java class with private attributes and public getter/setter methods.
- Use encapsulation to protect class members.
- Create and manage multiple instances of a class.
- Accept user input using the `Scanner` class.
- Display object data in a readable format using the `toString()` method.

If not, continue below.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Java (if not installed)**

üîπ For Windows:

1. Go to the [Oracle Java Downloads webpage](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/?er=221886)

2. Download and install the latest Java SE Development Kit (JDK).

3. During installation, check the option to ‚ÄúSet JAVA_HOME variable‚Äù.

4. Restart your terminal.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify installation**
